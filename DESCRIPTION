Description: PKPD models for anesthetics. Each model is implemented as a function. The function returns always a vector with V1,V2,V3,Cl1,Cl2,Cl3,ke0 - For two compartment model the V3 (and Cl3) would be 0. If no ke0 is available, ke0 is NA. There is a PKPDTools function tpeak2ke= for calculation of a ke0 from tpeak.
